# Problem statement:
  --------------------
Write a solution to report all the duplicate emails. Note that its guaranteed that the email field is not NULL.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.
  
# Table schema:
  -----------------
Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |

# Output:
  -------------------------
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |

# Solution:
  --------------------------
    SELECT email
    FROM Person
    GROUP BY email
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
