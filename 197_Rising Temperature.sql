# Problem statement:
  --------------------
Write a solution to find all dates' id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.
  
# Table schema:
Table: Weather

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the column with unique values for this table.
There are no different rows with the same recordDate.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
  
# Input:
  -------------------------
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+

# Output:

# Solution:
  --------------------------
WITH INC AS (
    SELECT id,
    temperature,
    recordDate,
    LAG(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prev_temp,
    LAG(recordDate) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prev_date
    FROM weather
)
SELECT Id
FROM INC
WHERE temperature > prev_temp
AND DATEDIFF(recordDate,prev_date)=1
;
