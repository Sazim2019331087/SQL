# Problem statement:
  --------------------
Write a solution to calculate the bonus of each employee. 
The bonus of an employee is 100% of their salary if the ID of the employee is an odd number and the employees name does not start with the character 'M'. 
The bonus of an employee is 0 otherwise.
Return the result table ordered by employee_id.
The result format is in the following example.
  
# Table schema:
  -------------
Table: Employees

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the employee ID, employee name, and salary.
  
# Input:
---------
Employees table:
+-------------+---------+--------+
| employee_id | name    | salary |
+-------------+---------+--------+
| 2           | Meir    | 3000   |
| 3           | Michael | 3800   |
| 7           | Addilyn | 7400   |
| 8           | Juan    | 6100   |
| 9           | Kannon  | 7700   |
+-------------+---------+--------+

# Output:
----------
+-------------+-------+
| employee_id | bonus |
+-------------+-------+
| 2           | 0     |
| 3           | 0     |
| 7           | 7400  |
| 8           | 0     |
| 9           | 7700  |
+-------------+-------+

# Solution:
  --------------------------
SELECT
      employee_id
    , CASE
        WHEN MOD(employee_id,2)=1 AND name NOT LIKE 'M%' THEN salary
        ELSE 0
      END as bonus
FROM Employees
ORDER BY employee_id
